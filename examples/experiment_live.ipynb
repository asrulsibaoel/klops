    "## Versioning Our Data  \n",
    "Versioning our data is required in every machine learning project. Here are some reasons why data versioning is needed.  \n",
    "- **Ensure better training data**: ML comprises rapid experimentation, iteration, and training models on data. Thus, training on incorrect data can have disastrous results for the outcomes of an ML project.  \n",
    "- **Track data schema**: Enterprise data is usually obtained in batches, and often minor changes in the ML schema are applied throughout a project. With proper versioning, you can easily track and evolve the data schema over time. You can also understand whether these changes are backward and forward compatible.  \n",
    "- **Continual model training**: In production environments, data is refreshed periodically and may trigger a new run of the model training pipeline. When such automated retraining occurs, it is essential to have data versioned for tracking a modelâ€™s efficacy.  \n",
    "- **Enhance traceability and reproducibility**: Data scientists must be able to track, identify the provenance of data, and point out which version of a dataset reinforces the outcomes of their experiments. They should re-run the entire ML pipeline and reproduce the exact results each time as it is a critical input for the modeling process. Thus, the original training data must always be available. Hence, from a reproducibility/traceability perspective, proper versioning is critical.  \n",
    "- **Auditing**: Proper versioning ensures that the integrity of data-based activities is upheld by identifying when modifications are made. By monitoring and analyzing the actions of both users and models, auditors can identify intentional and accidental lapses in user behavior. Data science auditors can thus examine the effect of data changes on model accuracy and determine best ML practices for the enterprise.  \n",
    "This can be done by using our Klops Versioning. Klops Versioning is a kind of version control based on DVC. It is a wrapper for DVC. This wrapper aimed to make every DVC command code minded. "
